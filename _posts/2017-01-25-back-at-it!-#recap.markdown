Currently Iâ€™m working on developing a prototype to test with users. I would like to gain an idea of what scenarios I can plug into other than or instead of the ones I have come up with, whether that be in the brainstorming process, or taking work from low fidelity to high fidelity. I also want to continue to think about how my tool will work in a team setting over individual settings and what assumptions come with that. I see the aspects of a team playing a critical part in my work.

To date I have developed 1 functioning example of a design tool ([Jasper](http://rehanbutt.com/colorbot)), I would like to port this to slack to observe team interactions over individual interactions as the team aspects is far more compelling. By next week I also plan to have a scripted Alexa bot that will help surface images in a brainstorming scenario. As of now the only needs I have will be in development of interacting with the Alexa APIs and other APIs further down the road.
