This week I was looking into finding papers to help with my research process specifically exploring [dl.acm.org](dl.acm.org) .

One paper that seemed quite compelling and relevant was [“Duer: Intelligent Personal Assistant”](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2983372) sadly they did not include the full text only the abstract. As Duer is Baidu’s personal assistant the paper definitively talks about how the assistant can be personal at the user level when being as big as Baidu. Dr. Wang describes three elements of the assistant that help it be “Baidu’s intelligent personal assistant”. First understanding user requirements through explicit utterances, user modals, and rich context. I would be interested to see what defines a rich context given the available information. Secondarily looking at user information and uses across all of Baidu’s products. And thirdly, to keep the interactions as natural as possible allowing for many types of input including text, speech and images.

Another paper looks at the [optimization process](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=291125&CFID=723027611&CFTOKEN=34315426) of mechanical engineers. There biggest challenge seems to be the diverse users base. Users with no knowledge on how to produce an optimization, users with limited knowledge where their tool helped these users perform a bit better, and power users that wanted more information to help them create an even better optimization. This type of user structure reminds me a lot of the [data visualization work](http://rehanbutt.com/consumerreports) I did when I was at Consumer Reports. As I was tasked with trying to help all types of user decide if a certain car was for them; Some users, mostly those would did not know much about cars wanted to know just a yes or no to the purchase, Where other users wanted to know every detail about the car and make the decision by themselves. For my work I think I’ll limit it to one kind of user to eliminate trying to boil the ocean.
